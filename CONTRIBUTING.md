## Finding Issues via GrantFox

1. Visit the [GrantFox contributor app](https://contribute.grantfox.xyz) and find the **Adamantine-Guild / guildpass-sdk** project.
2. Browse issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted`.
3. Apply for an issue on GrantFox, or comment `I'd like to work on this` on the GitHub issue.
4. Wait for a maintainer to assign it before starting — this avoids duplicate effort.

Direct GitHub filters:

- [`good first issue`](https://github.com/Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-sdk/issues?q=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)
- [`help wanted`](https://github.com/Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-sdk/issues?q=label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript only** — no plain JavaScript files.
- **No `any`** without a clear comment explaining why.
- **Public APIs must have TypeDoc comments** — every exported function, class, and type.
- **Tests required** — every new public method must have at least one Vitest unit test.
- **No side effects** — the package sets `"sideEffects": false`. Keep it that way.
- **Minimal dependencies** — the SDK has zero runtime dependencies by design. Do not add any without prior discussion with a maintainer.
- **Formatting** — run `pnpm format` (Prettier) before submitting.
- **Linting** — run `pnpm lint` (ESLint) and fix all reported issues.
- **Keep the public API clean** — prefer extending existing interfaces over adding new ones.

---

## Branching & Commits

- Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`
- Conventional commits:
  - `feat: add client.membership.getHistory() method`
  - `fix: handle 404 response from access.checkAccess()`
  - `test: add unit tests for roles service`
  - `docs: add SIWE authentication example`
  - `chore: upgrade vitest to 2.x`
  - `refactor: extract HTTP client into shared utility`

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against `Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-sdk` on `main`.
3. Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) completely.
4. Ensure these pass before submitting:

```bash
pnpm typecheck    # Must pass with no errors
pnpm lint         # Fix all reported issues
pnpm test:run     # All tests must pass
pnpm build        # Build must succeed
```

### PR Quality Expectations

- All new public methods/types have TypeDoc comments.
- New behaviour is covered by at least one Vitest test.
- No new runtime dependencies without prior maintainer approval.
- Public API changes include documentation updates in `docs/`.
- Semver impact is noted in the PR description (patch / minor / major).

---

## Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR within **5 business days**.
- Address requested changes promptly.
- Breaking changes (major version) require additional design discussion.
- Once approved and CI passes, a maintainer merges and releases.
